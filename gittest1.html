<title>Hello Git</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Testing setting up GIT - first change (nothing happened) </p>
<p>- copied this file to bluemarker_git directory that Github created when I created a new repository and named it bluemarker_git.  I thought I had broswed to my desktop folder named the same but the index.html file didn't show up.</p>
